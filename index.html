      <h4>The Meeting ‚Äì April 2017</h4>
      <p>Our story began one night in Chicago. Adam had moved to Chicago from Pittsburgh a few months before, and Anne was in town visiting family for the weekend. Friends invited both of us out for the night, and it ended up that we were the only people other than our mutual friends to show up. It took a while for us to start talking that night, but once we did, we never stopped. Adam drove Anne home that night, and we exchanged numbers.</p>
      <p>Anne went back to Philadelphia after that weekend, but our conversation continued by text for months. The next time Anne was back in Chicago, we were determined to see each other again. Both of us had plans with our parents that weekend, but once those plans were over, we met up and decided we should date, even if we lived in separate cities. Neither one of us remembers our first date because we were already together before we went on a ‚Äúreal‚Äù date.</p>
      <p>For the next year, we visited each other every few weeks in Chicago, Philadelphia, or Pittsburgh. It was hard being apart, but every time we saw each other, it was well worth it. After a year of being long distance, we missed each other too much, and we planned a cross-country move. Anne moved back to Chicago in 2018, and we have been together ever since!</p>
      <h4>The Proposal ‚Äì May 2020</h4>
      <p>During the Covid-19 lockdown, Adam started working from home and Anne already did, so we were together 24-7. We had a lot of time to look on Zillow and found a condo we loved in Wrigleyville. We moved in on Memorial Day weekend 2020.</p>
      <p>Two days after the move, Adam suggested we go up to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to celebrate and get a haircut (Wisconsin was much more open than Illinois at the time!) He insisted we bring a small flat box with us on our trip. We spent the day walking around Lake Geneva after Adam finally got his haircut. We finally found a good spot to settle with a blanket in a park. Inside that small flat box was puzzle pieces that spelled out a proposal! Adam proposed with a beautiful sapphire ring, and Anne was so happy to say yes!</p>
      <p>It was quite the eventful Memorial Day weekend, and we are thrilled to have an equally memorable Memorial Day 2022 as we celebrate our story and love with you!</p>

      <h4 class="storyHeading">The Meeting ‚Äì April 2017</h4>
      <p>Our story began one night in Chicago. Adam moved from Pittsburgh to Chicago a few months before, and I was in town visiting family for the weekend. Friends invited both of us out for the night, and we were the only people other than our mutual friends to show up. It took us a while to start talking that night, but once we did, we never stopped. Adam drove me home that night, and we exchanged numbers. 
      <p>I went back to Philadelphia after that weekend, but our converstaion continued via text over the course of the next few months. The next time I was back in Chicago, we were determined to see each other again. Both of us had plans with our parents that weekend, but once those plans were over, we met up and ecided to date, even if we lived in separate cities. Neither of us can remember our first date because we were already together before we even went on a ‚Äúreal‚Äù date.</p>
      <h4 class="storyHeading">The Move - 2018</h4>
      <p>For the next year, we visited each other every few weeks in Chicago, Philadelphia, or Pittsburgh. It was hard being apart, but every time we saw each other, it was well worth it. After a year of being long-distance, we missed each other too much, and we planned a cross-country move. I moved back to Chicago in 2018 and we have been together ever since!</p>
      <h4 class="storyHeading">The Proposal ‚Äì May 2020</h4>
      <p>During the Covid-19 lockdown, Adam started working from home and I already was, so we were together 24-7. We had a lot of time to look on Zillow and found a condo we loved in Wrigleyville. We moved in on Memorial Day weekend 2020.</p>
      <p>Two days after the move, Adam suggested we go up to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to celebrate and get a haircut (Wisconsin was much more open than illinois at the time!). He insisted we bring a small flat box with us on our trip. We spent the day walking around Lake Geneva after Adam finally got his haircut. We eventually found a park with a good spot to settle with a blanket. Inside that small flat box were puzzle pieces that spelled out a proposal! Adam proposed with a beautiful sapphire ring, and Anne was so happy to say yes!</p>
      <p>It was quite the eventful Memorial Day weekend, and we are thrilled to have an equall memorable Memorial Day kn 2022 as we celebrate our story and love with you!</p>

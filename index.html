                    <p>A complementary shuttle will be provided for all guests attending the wedding. All guests are encouraged to please use the shuttle regardless if you are staying at the Ambassador! The shuttle will pick up at the Ambassador Chicago Hotel and will transport guests to St. George Greek Orthodox Church. After the church wedding, the shuttles will transport all guests to Ovation Chicago. Starting at 10:30pm, the shuttle will make regular trips from Ovation back to the Ambassador Hotel. Please see the departure times below from the Ambassador Chicago:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>3:15pm</li>
                      <li>3:30pm</li>

                    <h3 class="agendaHeader">Public Transportation and Rideshare</h3>
                    <p>Chicago features one of the best public transportation systems in the United States. All of the wedding locations are easily accessible to public transportation. The 'L' train, or Elevated Train, covers the entire city and can transport you the entire weekend. Tickets are very cheap, with single rides costing $2.50 per person and day passes costing only $5 for unlimited rides.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador Hotel is within a five minute walk from the Clark/Division Red Line Station. St. George Greek Orthodox Church is within a two minute walk from the Diversey Brown Line Station.</p>
                    <p>Rideshare services are plentiful throughout the city. Memorial Day Weekend is traditionally a very busy time for tourists, so we recommend either booking rides in advance using the reservation feature or to allow plenty of time in case fares are high.</p>
                    <p>Once you make your way to either the Ambassador or St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, a shuttle will provide transportation for the rest of the evening.</p>

          <h3 class="headers fs-2 text-left lh-1">Cookie Table</h3>
          <p>The Pittsburgh cookie table, a southwestern Pennsylvania Tradition, is said to have started during the Great Depression. Like others worldwide, Pittsburghers struggled. Still life went on, couples married and often celebrated with a reception after the wedding ceremony. However, many Pittsburghers simply could not afford a wedding cake. Instead, as legend goes, the mother of the bride, extended family, and closest friends baked cookies from scratch with recipes passed down through several generations. By the time Pittsburgh recovered from the Great Depression, the cookie table had become a treasured tradition.</p>
          <p>Anne and Adam will be having a cookie table at their wedding. Cookies will be prepared by family and friends from scratch and served at the reception and will also be given to guests to take home at the end of the night. Any guests who would like to participate in preparing cookies for the wedding are more than welcome to! If you would like to bring cookies, please email Danielle at <a href="mailto:danielledrakulic@aol.com">danielledrakulic@aol.com</a> and let her know what type and how many cookies you would like to bring.</p>

                <h4 class="storyHeading">The Meeting – April 2017</h4>
                <p>Our story began in Chicago when mutual friends invited us out for the night. Anne went back to Philadelphia where she was living at the time, but our conversation continued over the next few months. The next time Anne was in Chicago, we met up and decided to date, even though we lived in separate cities. Neither of us can remember our first date because we were already together before we went on a “real” date.</p>
                <h4 class="storyHeading">The Move - 2018</h4>
                <p>For the next year, we visited each other every few weeks in Chicago, Philadelphia, or Pittsburgh. After a year of being long-distance, we planned a cross-country move. Anne moved back to Chicago in 2018, and we have been together ever since!</p>
                <h4 class="storyHeading">The Proposal – May 2020</h4>
                <p>During the Covid-19 lockdown, we were together 24-7. We had a lot of time to look on Zillow and found a condo we loved in Wrigleyville. We moved on Memorial Day weekend 2020.</p>
                <p>Two days after the move, Adam suggested we go up to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to celebrate. He insisted we bring a small flat box with us on our trip. Inside that small flat box were puzzle pieces that spelled out "Will you marry me?" Adam proposed with a beautiful sapphire ring, and Anne was so happy to say yes!</p>
                <p>It was quite the eventful Memorial Day weekend, and we are thrilled to have an equally memorable Memorial Day in 2022 as we celebrate our story and love with you!</p>
